    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>My mathematical education has helped me further develop my ability to think logically. Besides numerical operations and theory, I learned how to think critically and problem solve. These skills have helped me to create websites which provide smooth user functionality. I am also able to find patterns in databases and determine how the tables relate to each other. So deep is my love for math that my initials are even Roman numerals!</p>
